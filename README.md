# SpellChecker
Here I took an Object-Oriented approach in creating a SpellChecker program. I created a dictionary object for the ease of editing the SpellChecker's dictionary.
I made the SpellChecker use an external dictionary if given in the constructor, otherwise an empty dictionary is created in the SpellChecker.
The SpellChecker contains methods for determining the similarity between two words and for finding the most similar words in the dictionary to a given incorrect word.
